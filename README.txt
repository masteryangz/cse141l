## Challenges Faced
- Hardcoded Branching: The near-hardcoded nature of the branching system restricts the flexibility of the instruction set. This design choice, while perhaps optimizing for the current applications, severely hampers the ability to adapt the ISA for new or evolving software requirements.

- Limited Application Scope: Since the ISA is tailored specifically for these three programs, it may lack general-purpose instructions that could facilitate broader software development. This specialization can limit the use of the hardware for different types of software applications beyond the initial scope.

- Flexibility and Scalability Issues: The design does not easily accommodate changes or extensions, which are crucial for adapting to new technologies or optimizing existing processes. The inability to modify or enhance the branching logic without significant redesign indicates a potential bottleneck for future development and maintenance.
